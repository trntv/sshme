# Tips
1. to store passwords you need to install sshpass that allows to offer a password via SSH

    to install it with brew use
    ```
    brew install http://git.io/sshpass.rb
    ```
    for other options see: [https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass](https://github.com/kevinburke/sshpass)

2. To see all available ssh options run ``man ssh_config``
